## Description

  This is the first project for a student working towards a career in web development. The project helps to strengthen knowledge in the fundamentals in HTML, Git, and CSS. 

  For this assignment, code was given for a student to clean up and condense. The code included many <div> tags that were then replaced with various HTML semantic tags to give the code a better meaning that could then be further expanded upon by future developers. <alt> tags were also added to the images in the code to provide accessibility for screen reader users as well as if the images do not load on the webpage. The CSS file was then fixed as well. It was first placed in sequential order. Then some of the classes were condensed into the same line that provided the same function to condense the length of the code.
